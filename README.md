# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
## The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

## Below are the contents in the project

* A  code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations the data called CodeBook.md.
* A R script called run_analysis.R, which is used to create the tidy data set
* tidy_data_output.txt output file contains the cleansed dataset
* A README.md file for details. This is the file


## Process to get the tidy data

* Download the analysis data and save in working directory called UCI HAR Dataset
* Refer code book for details of R script and get understanding of the logic
* Execute run_analysis.R script and generate tidy dataset 
* Review the tidy dataset, tidy_data_output.txt
